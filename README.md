# ecg-file-processing
Base code for the KUMC ECG filter and processor. The website is currently in development but users will be able to upload their own Philip's ECGs (other ECG machines in the future) and have them filtered for CRT and normal pacemaker pacing spikes and outliers as well as get back diagnostic data about their patients in near real time.
